Codeception Talk
================

This repo contains some slides for an introduction to Codeception which
you can find on [GitHub Pages][1] (sources under [`/docs`](/docs)). In these slides there are some example
tests. Under [`/example`](/example) you can find a sample project with a working
Codeception setup including those tests from the talk.

Coding Challenge
----------------

The talk also includes a small challenge to practice how to setup and
use Codeception to test your code/application. To get you started with
this challenge there is a [boilerplate repository][2] with composer
pre-setup which also includes some instructions for the challenge.
